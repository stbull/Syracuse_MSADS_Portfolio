## Description

At Syracuse University, the Master’s program in Applied Data Science through the School of Information Studies allows its students to learn different techniques of collecting, analyzing, and find solutions in many types of data coming from various sources. In today’s day and age, it is becoming more and more apparent that having the skills to work with data is an integral part of the modern workplace. This program, through courses such as an Introduction to Data Science , Database Administration Concepts and Database Management , Big Data Analytics , and Information Visualization has allowed me to both continue building up skills I learned during my undergraduate collegiate career and create new ones. With the skills I’ve learned through programs and coding languages like Microsoft Excel and Access, R-Studio, and Python (to name a few), I’m confident that I now have the ability to be an insightful knowledgeable, and detail-oriented member of any career path I may take moving forward.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69982397/119164810-c9aec900-ba2a-11eb-8e4e-6ac4989b0ecc.png)
